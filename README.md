# Steer 

Ever felt the need of maps or some navigation system inside of a building? Here is our project Steer that fulfills your navigation and guidance needs inside of buildings and monuments, with an easy to use, interactive and intuitive User Interface.


## Unique Selling Points

1.	Helps you move around without getting lost inside of the building but it is even more interactive and with an intuitive UI.
2.	Highly customisable indoor navigation system right in the palm of your hand which will never let you get lost again in the big corporate buildings, hospitals and other such places.
3. As commercial implementation, all one needs to do is to scan a QR code that can be there at the entrance of the building and enter the current location and then the desired location in the app which will then will guide them through the buildong, just as wonderfully Google Maps would do, in the outside world.
4.The project can be scaled and integrated with voice tours of monuments to act like a virtual tour guide.

## Implementation
We intend to use Unity integrated with Native Android Dev and AR to convert the blueprint of an architectural structure into a 3-D compatible navigation system API.

* Unity – 3D model creationThe 3-D model of the building shall be implemented using Unity which will be further used in path finding inside the building model.
* Native Android Dev – UI of the implementation through a App
Run an instance of our unity project in native. Obtain information like starting point and destination from the user using the application interface to integrate with unity. 
* We itend to use AR to get the above stated details else we use GPS and compass to guide.


## Technology Stack
* Flutter Android Dev 
* Unity
* AR 

## Challenges
